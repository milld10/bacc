There exist many applications that offer the service to store user credentials safely. To synchronize data between multiple devices they rely on cloud services where data confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
Mobile phones offer a secure way to store data, for example through hardware-backed key storage.
By relying on this technology, we can provide secure data storage for user credentials.
