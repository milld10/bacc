\section*{Abstract} \label{cha:abstract}
In this thesis, we present a novel approach to provide secure access to passwords across multiple devices. Recent security issues concerning cloud services have shown that depending on third-parties for availability can compromise confidentiality. Our goal is to manage credentials without depending on third-party services. Thus, we rely on hardware-backed keystores of modern mobile devices to securely store credentials. To make passwords available, we rely on a Bluetooth connection between the mobile device and the web browser. \\
To achieve this goal, we implemented an Android application and an accompanying Chrome web extension. The extension retrieves data sent from the application and fills it directly into the login forms of the website. To access and distribute passwords, the user must authenticate using biometric identification.
