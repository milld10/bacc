\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
With this project, we presented the possibility of eliminating external dependencies while providing availability across multiple devices. Sensitive data is stored securely on the Android device. The cryptographic key lies securely in the hardware-backed environment provided by the Android system, where extraction is made almost infeasible. The distribution of credentials is accomplished by a \gls{ble} connection between a browser extension and the Android application. The user securely accesses and distributes credentials by authentication through biometrics. We replaced authentication with PIN or pattern through fingerprint to provide reasonable security while still maintaining usability. This avoids usage of insecure PINs and patterns which can result in insecure storage of credentials.
