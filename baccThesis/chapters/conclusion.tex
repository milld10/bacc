\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
With this project, we presented the possibility of eliminating external dependencies while providing accessibility throughout multiple devices. Sensitive data is stored securely on an Android device. Distribution is made possible by a \gls{ble} connection between a browser extension and the Android application. The cryptographic key is protected by the hardware provided \gls{tee}, where extraction is made impossible. To authenticate the access and distribution of credentials, we have made use of biometrics. By replacing authentication with PIN or pattern through fingerprint, high security is provided while still preserving convenience. This avoids generation of unsafe PINs and patterns which can result in insecure storage of credentials.

We have encountered limitations when a mobile device has enabled root privilege. Through root privilege, the security of a smartphone is exceedingly compromised leading to a vulnerable option to store sensitive data. Through the \gls{ble} connection, security can be compromised as well when the keys exchanged during the pairing process can be retrieved. This results in insecure future connections where credentials can be phished.
