\section{Bluetooth and it's Security}
\label{bluetooth}

intro with bluetooth classic and for what it is normally used. large data, consistent connection communication channel. but secure.; paper security about bluetooth classes.
ref section limitations that we cannot use BT classic because of API. we chose ble because of the chrome web bluetooth api.

we use BLE: what is BLE, how is it differenct from bt classic and for what it is used, list all advantages and how it conributes to this project. general structure of bluetooth low energy, common usage and applications nowadays.
doesnot need much energy, no consistant communication channel less battery. we only advertised upon selection of credentials and once they are sent, the app does not keeps advertising and the user has to select an other credentials and authenticated themselves.
for our purposes ideal but, explain about the protcol stack is built differently compared to bt classes. different protocols makes it more insecure [paper with low energy, come low security]

paket sniffer, protocoll stack is different than bt classic

low energy for small data pakets, communication does not need to be constantly open.
